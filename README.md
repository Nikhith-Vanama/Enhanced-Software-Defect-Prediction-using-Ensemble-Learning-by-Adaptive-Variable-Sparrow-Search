# Enhanced-Software-Defect-Prediction-using-Ensemble-Learning-by-Adaptive-Variable-Sparrow-Search

> The project integrates ensemble learning with optimization algorithms to predict software defects with higher accuracy.

> It combines multiple machine learning classifiers into a unified model for better generalization.

> The Adaptive Variable Sparrow Search Algorithm (AVSSA) is applied to tune parameters dynamically.

> This ensures the model adapts efficiently to complex and diverse datasets.

> The outcome is a robust defect prediction framework with improved reliability.

# Adaptive Variable Sparrow Search Algorithm (AVSSA)

> AVSSA is an improved version of SSA that adapts variable control parameters dynamically.

> It balances exploration and exploitation in the optimization process.

> This prevents premature convergence and enhances global search ability.

> AVSSA uses adaptive coefficients to fine-tune position updates of sparrows.

> It provides superior performance in classification and prediction tasks.

# Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA)

> SSA is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm inspired by sparrow foraging behavior.
 
> Sparrows are divided into producers and scroungers, each playing distinct roles.
 
> Producers search for food sources while scroungers follow them to exploit resources.
 
> The algorithm alternates between exploration (finding new areas) and exploitation (optimizing solutions).

> SSA is widely used in optimization due to its simplicity and efficiency.

# Ensemble Learning Model (ELM)

> Ensemble learning combines multiple base classifiers into a single strong model.

> It reduces overfitting by aggregating diverse predictions from weak learners.
 
> Techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking are commonly used.

> In defect prediction, ensemble learning improves classification stability.

> It ensures higher accuracy compared to single classifiers.
