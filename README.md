> The project integrates ensemble learning with optimization algorithms to predict software defects with higher accuracy.

> It combines multiple machine learning classifiers into a unified model for better generalization.

> The Adaptive Variable Sparrow Search Algorithm (AVSSA) is applied to tune parameters dynamically.

> This ensures the model adapts efficiently to complex and diverse datasets.

> The outcome is a robust defect prediction framework with improved reliability.

# Adaptive Variable Sparrow Search Algorithm (AVSSA)

> AVSSA is an improved version of SSA that adapts variable control parameters dynamically.

> It balances exploration and exploitation in the optimization process.

> This prevents premature convergence and enhances global search ability.

> AVSSA uses adaptive coefficients to fine-tune position updates of sparrows.

> It provides superior performance in classification and prediction tasks.

# Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA)

SSA is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm inspired by sparrow foraging behavior.
Sparrows are divided into producers and scroungers, each playing distinct roles.
