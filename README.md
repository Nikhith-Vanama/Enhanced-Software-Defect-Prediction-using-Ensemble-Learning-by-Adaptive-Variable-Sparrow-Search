# Enhanced-Software-Defect-Prediction-using-Ensemble-Learning-by-Adaptive-Variable-Sparrow-Search

> The project integrates ensemble learning with optimization algorithms to predict software defects with higher accuracy.

> It combines multiple machine learning classifiers into a unified model for better generalization.

> The Adaptive Variable Sparrow Search Algorithm (AVSSA) is applied to tune parameters dynamically.

> This ensures the model adapts efficiently to complex and diverse datasets.

> The outcome is a robust defect prediction framework with improved reliability.
